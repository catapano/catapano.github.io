## Overview

I am interested in how consumer research can be leveraged to benefit society. In my first research stream, I examine how people can be shifted away from entrenched views, and factors that affect receptiveness to the opposition. In my second research stream, I explore the role of meaning in consumer satisfaction and decision-making. I am being co-advised by Zakary Tormala and Jennifer Aaker.
